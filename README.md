Description:    This project is meant to serve as a useful tool for its developer, Samantha Farley, so that she can store all of her recipes in one place. It stores 
                recipes in a Mongo database and allows the user to create, retrieve, update and delete recipes. A temporary solution is in place for image storage/retrieval as Samantha has not finished rolling out a complete solution for uploading images to a database yet. Additionally, only a fraction of recipes have been added to the database; many more will be added in the future.

Notes:          Recipes are sorted in the homepage in order from highest to lowest rating
                Queries can be made in the search bar for:
                - ingredients   (e.g., "tomatoes")
                - tags          (e.g., "comfort food", "kid-friendly")
                - course type   (e.g., "dinner")
                - category      (e.g., "cooking")
                - cuisine       (e.g., "Italian")
                - yield         (e.g., 4 servings)
                - season        (e.g., "Summer")
